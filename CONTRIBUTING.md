# Contributing

## Dev Environment

- Node.js ≥ 20 (ships with npm)

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Vite dev server
- `npm run build` – Build static site to `dist/`
- `npm run test` – Run Vitest
- `npm run test:cov` – Vitest with coverage
- `npm run lint` – ESLint
- `npm run fmt` – Prettier write
- `npm run fmt:check` – Prettier check
- `npm run typecheck` – `tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run check:pr` – Fail if `src` changed but tests didn’t
- `npm run check:dist` – Verify build output generated

## Build Artifacts

- `dist/` is generated by `npm run build` and stays untracked. If you need a local artifact (e.g., for manual smoke tests), run the build and keep the output out of commits.
- The historical `docs/` GitHub Pages folder has been removed; Pages consumes the `dist/` artifact uploaded by CI.

## Coding Style

- TypeScript strict; functional core, I/O at edges.
- Prefer small pure functions; dependency injection for clocks/timezone.
- Commit convention: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`).

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:cov
```
